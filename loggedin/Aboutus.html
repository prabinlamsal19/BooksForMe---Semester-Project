A Message From Our Co-Founder<br><br>

When I was in second grade, I discovered the Hardy Boys series. Ever since, I've loved to read — both for fun and to improve my mind. And I'm always looking for the next great book.<br><br>

One afternoon while I was scanning a friend's bookshelf for ideas, it struck me: when I want to know what books to read, I'd also make a bookshelf.<br><br>

So I decided to build a website – a place where I could make bookshelves.The team Matrix created this website for our school project but it could much more and reach to the world.<br><br>

BOOKSFORME is that site. It is a place where you can see what kind of books are more popular than other. You can create "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or want to read).You can find your next favorite book. And on this journey with your friends you can explore new territory, gather information, and expand your mind.<br><br>
